FoodHub Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview

This project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the FoodHub dataset. The primary objective is to extract valuable insights regarding customer behavior, operational performance, and restaurant preferences. This analysis aims to help FoodHub optimize its operations and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Context

The number of restaurants continues to grow steadily, catering to the needs of students and busy professionals who often rely on dining out due to their demanding schedules. Online food delivery services have become a convenient solution for such individuals, offering access to quality meals from their preferred eateries. A food delivery platform called FoodHub simplifies this process by providing users with a single app to order from a variety of restaurants.

Through the app, restaurants receive direct online orders from customers. Once an order is confirmed, the app assigns a delivery driver to pick it up. The driver uses GPS navigation to reach the restaurant and waits for the food to be prepared. After receiving the order, the driver confirms the pickup in the app and proceeds to deliver the food to the customer's location. Upon completing the delivery, the driver confirms the drop-off in the app. Customers have the option to rate their orders within the app. FoodHub generates revenue by charging restaurants a fixed percentage of each delivery order.

### Objective

The food delivery platform has collected data on various orders placed by its registered customers through its online app. The company aims to analyze this data to gain insights into the popularity and demand for different restaurants. This analysis will help them improve customer satisfaction and overall service quality. By addressing key business questions, the platform seeks to enhance its operational efficiency, boost customer engagement, and increase profitability.
